\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present our fact-checking pipeline which has scored first in \averitec{} shared task. Our fact-checking system is a simple two-step RAG pipeline based on our last year's submission. We show how the pipeline can be redeployed on-premise, achieving state-of-the-art fact-checking performance (in sense of \evr{} test-score), even under the constraint of a single Nvidia A10 GPU, 23GB of graphical memory and 60s running time per claim.

\section*{Limitations}
Our pipeline is not meant to be relied upon nor to replace a human fact-checker, but rather to assist an informed user. It gives sources and proposed labels for further questioning. It is optimized only for English, the carbon costs of the used models are considerable, despite the system trying to cut down the environmental cost of the prediction step.

\section*{Ethics statement}
Our pipeline is an extension of our already existing last year submission all original authors agreed with, including the reusal of the necessary listing in Appendix~\ref{appendix_sec:system_prompt}.
The system was build specifically for the~\averitec~shared task and reflects the biases of its annotators, for more information on this, we suggest the original AVeriTeC paper~\cite{averitec2024}.
